      "As you read, please excuse all of the exclamation points I'm about to use. I absolutely loved Myrian!!! She is an incredible belly dancer and so professional! We had a black tie wedding and she showed up with a STUNNING wardrobe! She fit in perfectly and really added a special touch to our cocktail hour! If I could repeat my wedding night, I would 1000% hire her again. (I would have loved to have seen her dance with fire, but it wasn't allowed at our venue. She was incredible at dancing with a sword.)",
