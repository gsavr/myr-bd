            Born and raised in Andalusia, Spain, I{"'"}ve been dancing
            professionally for over 15 years. Winner of the famous Miss
            Bellydance Spain contest in 2008.

          <p>
            My journey in the dance world began with flamenco, and later I moved
            to Paris, France, to complete my studies. There, I explored various
            styles such as Bollywood, African, Hip hop, Salsa, and bellydancing.
            When I discovered bellydancing, I found my true passion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Continuing my dance education in Spain, Morocco, and Egypt, I
            trained with master teachers like Jillina, Dina, Amir Thaleb,
            Soraia, Sadie, Zuel, Aida, Devorah Korek, Mohammed El Sayed...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With expertise in a wide array of styles, from Egyptian Raqs Sharqi,
            Turkish, American Cabaret, Folkloric to Theatrical Fusion, I have
            also incorporated fire dance, flow arts, and Lebanon and Syrian
            Dabke.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Bellydance is my greatest passion in life, and I strive to showcase
            it in my lively and interactive performances. Hypnotizing, charming,
            and ready to kickstart the party, I am a dynamic bellydancer with a
            special passion for wings, veil, fan veil, candle tray, sword, and
            finger cymbals.
